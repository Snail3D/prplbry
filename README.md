# 🫐 prplbry

Chat with Ralph. Build a PRD. Done.

*The hamster tastes like chicken.* — Hee hee.

---

## What It Does

You chat. Ralph listens. PRD appears.

Type what you're building. Ralph asks the right questions. Features get organized. Categories form. Tasks emerge. Export to Claude Code and you're building.

That's the Ralph loop.

---

## How

1. Go to **prplbry.com**
2. Tell Ralph your idea
3. Watch the PRD build itself
4. Copy, paste into Claude Code

*My cat's breath smells like cat food.* — Hee hee.
